    "question": "Given an array of distinct integers 'candidates' and a target integer 'target', return a list of all unique combinations where the chosen numbers sum to the target. Each number can be used unlimited times, and combinations must be unique based on frequency.",
    "example": "Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7; Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]\nInput: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8; Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]\nInput: candidates = [2], target = 1; Output: []\nInput: candidates = [1], target = 1; Output: [[1]]\nInput: candidates = [1], target = 2; Output: [[1,1]]",
    "constraint": "1 <= candidates.length <= 30; 1 <= candidates[i] <= 200; All elements of 'candidates' are distinct; 1 <= target <= 500; Maximum 150 unique combinations for any input.",
