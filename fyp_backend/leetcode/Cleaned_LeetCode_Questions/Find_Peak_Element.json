    "question": "Given an integer array nums, find a peak element that is strictly greater than its neighbors and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index of any of the peaks. Ensure the algorithm runs in O(log n) time.",
    "example": "Input: nums = [1,2,3,1] Output: 2 (Explanation: 3 is a peak element at index 2). Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4] Output: 5 (Explanation: Function can return either index 1 for peak 2 or index 5 for peak 6).",
    "constraint": "1 <= nums.length <= 1000, -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31-1, nums[i] != nums[i+1] for all valid i. Treat nums[-1] and nums[n] as -\u221e.",
