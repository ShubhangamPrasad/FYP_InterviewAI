    "question": "Given an array of integers citations, where citations[i] represents the number of citations for the i-th paper, calculate the h-index based on the definition which states that h is the maximum number such that h papers have at least h citations each, and the remaining papers have no more than h citations.",
    "example": "Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each, and the remaining two papers have no more than 3 citations each.\nInput: citations = [1,3,1]\nOutput: 1",
    "constraint": "n == citations.length, 1 <= n <= 5000, 0 <= citations[i] <= 1000",

First, we sort the citations array in descending order.\n2. Then, we iterate through the sorted array and compare each value with its index + 1 (zero-based index). If citations[i] is greater or equal to (i + 1), we update the h-index with the new value (i + 1). Otherwise, we break the loop since the maximum h-index is achieved.\n3. Finally, we return the h-index.\n    "
