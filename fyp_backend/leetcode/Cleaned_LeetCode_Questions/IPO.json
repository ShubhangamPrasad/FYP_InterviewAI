    "question": "Given initial capital, pick at most k projects with profits and capital requirements to maximize final capital.",
    "example": "Input: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]. Output: 4. Explanation: Start with project 0, earn profit 1, move to project 2, earn profit 3, final capital = 4.",
