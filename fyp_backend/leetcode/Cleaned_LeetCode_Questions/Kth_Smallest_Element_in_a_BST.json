    "question": "Given the root of a binary search tree and an integer k, return the kth (1-indexed) smallest element in the tree.",
    "example": "Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1; Output: 1. Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3; Output: 3.",
    "constraint": "1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, 0 <= Node.val <= 10^4. Number of nodes in the tree is n.",
    "followup": "If the BST is modified often and kth smallest search is frequent, how can this be optimized?",
