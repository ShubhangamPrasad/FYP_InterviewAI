    "question": "Given an m x n grid of non-negative numbers, find the path from top-left to bottom-right that minimizes the sum of all numbers along the path. You can only move down or right at any point in time.",
    "example": "Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]] Output: 7. Explanation: Path 1 \u2192 3 \u2192 1 \u2192 1 \u2192 1 minimizes the sum. Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]] Output: 12.",
    "constraint": "1 <= m, n <= 200, 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100, m == grid.length, n == grid[i].length",
