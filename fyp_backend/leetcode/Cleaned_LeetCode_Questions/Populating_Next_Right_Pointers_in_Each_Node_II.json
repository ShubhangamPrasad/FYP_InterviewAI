    "summary": "Populate next pointers in tree",
    "question": "Given a binary tree, populate each node's 'next' pointer to point to its next right node, or set it to NULL if no next right node exists.",
    "example": "Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]\nOutput: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#]\nExplanation: '#' indicates the end of each level. Input: root = []\nOutput: []",
    "constraint": "Tree size is in the range [0, 6000]. Node values are between -100 and 100. Use constant extra space, assuming implicit stack space is not extra space.",
    "followup": "You may only use constant extra space.",
