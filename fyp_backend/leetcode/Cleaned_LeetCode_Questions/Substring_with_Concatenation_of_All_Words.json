    "question": "Given a string s and an array of strings words, find all starting indices of substrings in s that are a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without intervening characters.",
    "example": "Input: s = \"barfoothefoobarman\", words = [\"foo\",\"bar\"] Output: [0,9]; Input: s = \"wordgoodgoodgoodbestword\", words = [\"word\",\"good\",\"best\",\"word\"] Output: []; Input: s = \"barfoofoobarthefoobarman\", words = [\"bar\",\"foo\",\"the\"] Output: [6,9,12]",
    "constraint": "1 <= s.length <= 10^4; s consists of lower-case English letters; 1 <= words.length <= 5000; 1 <= words[i].length <= 30; words[i] consists of lower-case English letters.",
