    "question": "Given an m x n grid 'board' of characters and a string 'word', determine if the 'word' can be formed by sequentially adjacent characters in the grid (horizontally or vertically). Each letter cell can be used only once.",
    "example": "Input: board = [[\"A\",\"B\",\"C\",\"E\"],[\"S\",\"F\",\"C\",\"S\"],[\"A\",\"D\",\"E\",\"E\"]], word = \"ABCCED\"; Output: true. Input: board = [[\"A\",\"B\",\"C\",\"E\"],[\"S\",\"F\",\"C\",\"S\"],[\"A\",\"D\",\"E\",\"E\"]], word = \"SEE\"; Output: true. Input: board = [[\"A\",\"B\",\"C\",\"E\"],[\"S\",\"F\",\"C\",\"S\"],[\"A\",\"D\",\"E\",\"E\"]], word = \"ABCB\"; Output: false.",
    "constraint": "1 <= m, n <= 6; 1 <= word.length <= 15; 'board' and 'word' consist of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.",
    "followup": "Could you use search pruning to make your solution faster with a larger grid?",
