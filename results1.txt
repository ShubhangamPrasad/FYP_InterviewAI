Summary:
The research highlights the potential changes in the software development landscape due to Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, which have the ability to generate code. An overview of the software development industry is given, along with an analysis of developer job roles. The study investigates how code-generating AI is changing software development and how developers are reacting to it. The study suggests that more than 70% of developers use or plan to use LLM based tool for coding, yet fewer than 50% completely trust these tools. The article aims to offer insight on how LLMs are implemented, provide a framework for implementing LLMs, and offer advice on how developers can adapt to this new environment. A Capability Maturity Model (CMM) is discussed for evaluating LLM-based software development. It concludes by acknowledging the uncertainty of AI's impact on job loss versus increased productivity, given the rapidly advancing technology is evolving faster than solid conclusions can be drawn.

Key_points:
This research paper aims to provide insight into the adoption of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) with Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, in software development. The paper explores how these technologies potentially change the software development landscape and the impacts they could have on software developers' jobs. The author adopts a literature review approach and a content analysis of online comments from developers to understand how GenAI is changing software development and how developers are responding to these changes. Key topics discussed in the article include the rise of GenAI, its implications for software developers, the efficiency of software developers, and a capability maturity model framework for assessing LLM development usage.

Relevance:
This paper investigates the impact of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot on the software development industry. The author examines whether the implementation of Generative AI (GenAI) and LLMs will either supplement existing developer skills or lead to significant job loss due to automation. 

Initial adoption rates suggest high usage of LLM-based tools within software development, with over 70% of developers using or planning to use them in their workflow. However, less than 50% of developers expressed trust in AI coding tools. 

The research aims to understand how LLMs are implemented in the software industry, provide a framework for implementing LLMs, and offer advice on navigating the new landscape. The study includes a review of the initial findings on LLMs' effects on software development, a content analysis of developer conversations, and introduces a capability-maturity model (CMM) for evaluating LLM-based software development.

Regarding the relevance to code quality, the paper indirectly suggests that LLMs like GitHub Copilot could help improve code quality by enabling developers to become more productive. However, it is also indicated that there might be a trust issue, as less than half of the developers "somewhat trust" or "highly trust" AI coding tools. This indicates that while these tools can potentially enhance code quality, their effectiveness might also rely on the user's ability and willingness to use them appropriately.

Metrics:
This excerpt does not provide specific metrics used for evaluating the model success in the context of Generative AI technologies using large language models like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. However, it discusses the need for a framework to evaluate the implementation of these models in the software industry. The paper also suggests using content analysis to assess the maturity of current LLM-based development efforts, implying that the maturity level could be a potential metric for measuring success. The author also hints at measuring success by assessing developers' trust in artificial intelligence tools, adaptation of the developers to the AI tools, and usage rates among developers.

Datasets:
The research paper "Navigating software development in the ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot era" by Stephen L. France utilizes a dataset from Stack Overflow, specifically the results of a survey conducted with over 90,000 developers. This dataset provided important insights into the adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) among software developers: revealing that over 70% of developers were using or planned to use LLM-based tools for coding in 2023, but fewer than 50% of developers reported that they “somewhat trust” or “highly trust” these AI coding tools.
Other implied datasets in the paper include online comments from developers which were subjected to content analysis, along with various studies and reports referenced throughout the paper which provide context and evidence about the impacts and uses of LLMs like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot in the software industry.

Findings:
In this paper, the author, Stephen L. France, explores the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technologies using large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, on the software development industry. He notes that these AI models, capable of generating creative outputs, are being rapidly implemented in software development, with nearly 25% of companies using them and over 70% of developers intending to use LLM-based tools. The implication of this widespread adoption has two contrasting views. Some believe AI could replace skilled jobs previously thought safe from automation, while others think AI could augment workers' existing skills, increasing productivity.

France's research aims to understand how LLMs are being implemented in the software industry, provide a framework for implementing LLMs, and offer advice on how developers can adapt to an environment where LLMs are ubiquitous. He applies a capability maturity model (CMM) framework, content analysis of developers' conversation, and an overview of the global software industry's current state to achieve these aims. The findings indicate that while developers are adoptive of the new AI technologies, there still exists a level of distrust and uncertainty predicting the overall future impact on software development.
